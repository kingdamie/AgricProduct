                <h5>Our Mission</h5>
                <p>
                    AgriPredict is designed to help farmers, agricultural businesses, and policymakers 
                    make informed decisions by providing accurate predictions of crop production, yield, 
                    and market prices based on various agricultural factors.
                </p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-4">How It Works</h5>
                <p>
                    Our system uses advanced machine learning models trained on historical agricultural 
                    data to predict key metrics. By inputting parameters like crop type, location, 
                    weather conditions, and policy factors, users can get reliable forecasts to guide 
                    their agricultural planning.
                </p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-4">The Technology</h5>
                <p>
                    The prediction engine is built with Python and scikit-learn, using a Random Forest 
                    regression model that has been trained on comprehensive agricultural datasets. The 
                    web interface is developed with Django and Bootstrap for a responsive user experience.
